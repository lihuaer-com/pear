			<h2>Save your favorite images</h2>
			<div class="textbox">
				<div class="entry">
					<p>We&#8217;re proud to introduce a brand new feature that allows you to keep track of all of your favorite images and albums.</p>
<p>We noticed that a lot of users have been treating the &#8220;liked images&#8221; section of their gallery profiles as a favorites list, which means that they were reserving their upvotes for only the very best images that they wanted to track. Or, if the image wasn&#8217;t in the gallery, people would often re-upload it into their own account. This was a poor user experience. We want you to be able to feel like you can freely give an upvote to any image you think needs more attention, and we certainly don&#8217;t want you to clutter up your own personal account images with images had to upload again.</p>
<p>Keeping these problems in mind, we&#8217;re finally ready to release the <em>favorites</em> feature. You can <em>fav</em> any image or album on the site (the hotkey is &#8217;0&#8242;), and you can even <em>fav</em> images that are directly linked (where the URL is like http://i.imgur.com/1234567.jpg). Just add /fav to the end of the url (like this: http://i.imgur.com/OJqW4Tr.jpg/fav).</p>
<p>All of your favorite images are stored in a separate section of your account, which you can access from your account menu. This section is completely private. The favorited images here will appear in their simple forms with no gallery comments when you browse them. The images you&#8217;ve added to your favorites from the Imgur Gallery will also be shown in the &#8220;Gallery favorites&#8221; section of your gallery profile and can be browsed by other users similar to the old &#8220;Liked images&#8221; section.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made the decision to get rid of the &#8220;Liked images&#8221; section in gallery profiles. To do this, we&#8217;ve moved all of your liked images into your favorites as a default. If you find that your favorites section is all cluttered up with images that you&#8217;ve liked in the past, you can chose to clear out your favorites and start from scratch.</p>
<p>The hotkey to favorite an image is 0.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite any image or album with the fav button:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RRwYcdx.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Favorite any image or album with /fav:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z5Qzds5.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Access your favorites from the account menu:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6J4HF4f.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Access your favorite gallery images from your gallery profile:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zdfxo47.png?1" /></div>
<p>So get back to browsing, vote freely and save your favorites. If you get a break, let us know what you think of the new feature in the blog comments.</p>

		<p>Not thrilled about this&#8230;.I use the thumbnail view to upvote stuff to look at later (i.e while Im at work and the image might contain&#8230;..questionable&#8230;.content).  Doing that I cant see them in my Favorites list now.</p>
<p>I guess the solution would be to add a heart button along with the upvote/downvote arrows when hovering over a thumbnail.  Or still let me see Liked images as a link under my Gallery Profile.</p>

		<p>I agree that is my comment exactly &#8211; there needs to be a favorites link on the thumbnail or again let us see the liked items in the gallery profile &#8211; I wasted today liking things so I can go back when not at work to find that they are not there.</p>

		<p>I like the favourites thing, it&#8217;s a nice addition that doesn&#8217;t change the typical pace that everyone is used to.</p>
<p>However, instead of increasing user submitted to 300 upvotes to get into the main gallery, I think it would be better to limit users to 1 or 2 submissions per day. I say this because every time I start browsing user submitted, I&#8217;ll go through about 20-30 images, then I&#8217;ll hit the &#8216;home&#8217; link (imgur logo) and see if I have any replies to comments I&#8217;ve made, when I do that, there&#8217;s usually 1+ new pages of new images&#8230; and that&#8217;s in 10-15 minutes. Also with limiting gallery submissions it could increase the quality of those submissions&#8230; COULD.</p>
<p>Other than that, I think you folks have done an excellent job with imgur and hope you keep up this fantastic work. =D</p>

		<p>So long as it didn&#8217;t stop people from uploading NOT for gallery views, preferring to instead use imgur for photo hosting to share images only with friends. Because if I couldn&#8217;t upload stuff to imgur, I couldn&#8217;t share my wips with my customers though a quick and easy system and would eventually just ditch the site. </p>
<p>P.S. Enjoyable feature. BUT you need the liked images section because wow, if you like an image you might want to go back and see it or what&#8217;s been posted on it someday. If you favorite an image you KNOW you want to see it, or share it. Different subjects, both deserving of their own section.</p>

		<p>So, I&#8217;ve upvoted images since this new favorites feature was added. Where did those go? I know that upvoted images pre-favorites feature were automatically added to favorites, but obviously they don&#8217;t currently do that. So where can I find my recently upvoted pictures?</p>

		<p>This is my concern as well. I thought both would be implemented, not the removal of another. Honestly I think this whole favorites thing is a waste of time. To me it&#8217;s the same as the liking feature, but with a different name. It&#8217;ll present the same problems users complained about before.</p>

		<p>It sounds like they&#8217;re saying that function is gone. If you want to bookmark an image now you&#8217;ll have to add it to your favorites.</p>

		<p>Please bring back Liked gallery. Kinda awful surprise to see it was removed after I cleared favorites. I mean, there was no reason not to clear it since they all would be in the liked gallery&#8230; or so I thought. =(</p>

		<p>I do like the favorites feature it is amazing, but I would still like to have a way to see what I upvoted so I can go to it later just in case I want to show someone but I don&#8217;t want to favorite it. Like if someone mentions something to me that reminds me of what I saw on here and want to be able to access it.</p>

		<p>Indeed. it&#8217;s rather disappointing that I&#8217;m supposed to Favorite every pic now to be able to access it again at a later point. give the list of up-voted images back</p>

		<p>Now we see all these &#8220;Press 0&#8243; images. Wonderful. The facebook &#8220;LIKE&#8221; mind is in full effect here.</p>

		<p>Exactly&#8230; I have to &#8220;favorite&#8221; those images now. But what if they are my favorite, but I like them? I still want to have access to my Liked Images</p>

		<p>Imgurawesometeam,</p>
<p>I believe I share the thoughts of many an imgurian in that I appreciate the favorites button and the effect (adding it to a list of favorited images), however I miss the ability to view my previously liked images.  I would feel much happier having the liked images gallery on my account as well as the favorited images gallery.<br />
Thank you,<br />
dudeface</p>

		<p>This is fine and everything, but why can&#8217;t we still see  list of liked images? Removing usability seems like a step backwards when this was so clearly supposed to be a step forwards!</p>

		<p>I would be fine with this if it didn&#8217;t take away the liked images section. I cannot see the images I liked before the favorite addition.</p>

		<p>I like the feature because I like a lot of posts and it&#8217;s nice to separate the ones I like and the ones I LOVE.. But I&#8217;d like to see the comments as well. Sometimes they&#8217;re the best part! And I&#8217;d also like the &#8216;Liked Images&#8217; back so I can view the two albums differently. I didn&#8217;t know the Liked Images was completely gone so I erased everything in my favorites to start saving only the ones I love, but now I can&#8217;t go back to the images I upvoted! D: I can&#8217;t even see what was the first image I liked that made me join this wonderful community. It saddens me <img src="http://imgur.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>I like the feature, but i hate how people are karma whoring about it. &#8220;Press 0 twice&#8221; Maybe remove the upvote when you unfavorite the picture.</p>

		<p>Favoriting something also upvotes it. i say, make it so it ONLY favorites. Or, when you unfavorite , it un-upvotes as well. that is all</p>

		<p>I like the favorites feature&#8230; BUT you should be able to clear the whole thing or at least delete more than one favorite at once.<br />
(I accidentally closed the thing saying you could start fresh and clear out all the liked one and now I have over a year of absentmindedly liked images clogging up my favorites)</p>

		<p>Please make a favorite section just for food.. So that people can check a box when adding food photos and albums <img src="http://imgur.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

		<p>I found myself using imgur more and more often after I found out about the liked gallery.  I would visit multiple times a day (probably too much).  Even more than Reddit.  Such a cool way to save pics and view history.  I guess the databases were getting too large.  Oh, well&#8230;I&#8217;m back to Reddit for daily browsing.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad we have a favorites button, however I still think there should be a &#8220;Liked Images&#8221; section where we can see what we liked&#8230; Because not everything I like I favor and I still want to see things I liked.</p>
