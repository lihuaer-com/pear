					<small>Wednesday, October 24th, 2012</small>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>Earlier this week we started a soft-launch of some really awesome new Imgur features, and along with those features came a new reputation system. After much more thought, I feel that we got the new system wrong. I&#8217;m not stoked about what we came up with, and the first rule of releasing features is don&#8217;t release anything you&#8217;re not stoked about.</p>
<p>There are several issues with the new system we introduced:</p>
<p>First, the top level, Glorious, should be something everyone can achieve with a bit of effort and should not be reserved for only the very top people. With the new &#8220;seven levels of Glorious&#8221;, the top level is ridiculously hard to reach. So hard in fact that it would take the person with the highest reputation <i>a million</i> more points to reach it. Even he probably feels like it&#8217;s unachievable, let alone the average Imgurian.</p>
<p>Second, after becoming Glorious, you are essentially downgraded to &#8220;Copper Neutral&#8221;. Personally, I&#8217;d rather stay at the awesome title that is Glorious. The titles should only get better and more epic, not start over again from the beginning.</p>
<p>Finally, we never solved the original problem, which was after reaching the top level there was nothing else to do. Even if the points were lower and everyone could achieve &#8220;Level 7 Glorious&#8221;, there would be nothing to do after that.</p>
<p>So clearly a couple things are wrong here. The titles after Glorious are not satisfying enough, it&#8217;s ridiculously hard to reach the top level, and even if you did, there&#8217;s nothing to do after that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing to fix all of this:</p>
<p>First, starting today, everyone with at least 20,000 reputation points will go back to being the awesomeness that is Glorious. Once you&#8217;re Glorious, each 10,000 additional points, up to a total of 80,000, will earn you a prestigious medallion. This should hopefully give people something more realistic to achieve, while adding a bit of flare to your profile. The medallions are: copper, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and imgurite.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/srpCr.png" alt="Imgur Medallions" /></p>
<p>Second, we&#8217;re introducing Imgur Trophies. Trophies will be achieved after doing something amazing, such as having the highest rated comment or image of the day, starting a huge 100 reply thread, etc. However, some of the more rare trophies will only be achievable by people who are Glorious. You&#8217;ll have to wait and see what these amazing trophies will be, but trust me, you will want them.</p>
<p>We still have a bit more work to do to wrap up on the trophies (not even we can introduce something this awesome in just a few days). But hopefully by the time the soft-launch is over, we will have a fully functional and running trophy system for everyone, and we&#8217;ll let you know exactly what it takes to win each one.</p>
<p>So, now you have Glorious going back to being realistic and awesome. You get sweet looking medallions in your profile for continuing to get even more reputation points. And finally, you can collect amazing trophies, and even rarer more unique trophies once you&#8217;re Glorious.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s that sound, Imgurians? Let us know in the comments, or feel free to contact us <a href="http://imgur.com/contact">here</a>.</p>
<p>With love,<br />
Alan Schaaf<br />
Founder and currently Renowned Imgurian</p>

					<small>Monday, October 22nd, 2012</small>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>Brace yourselves for the greatest Imgur innovation since the banana for scale. With community and user experience as the backbone of our decisions, we are proud to now allow users to upload directly into the gallery! The gallery previously required a user to share images across the web in order to increase the virality score, at which point the image would come back to Imgur&#8217;s gallery. We hope that this new feature will encourage you to take those great images you&#8217;ve been saving and share them with the world. </p>
<p>Additionally, the gallery now sports new sorting systems that will increase content quality, a new reputation system, our mascot and support for whole albums! </p>
<p>Read on for a full tutorial and explanation of all of the new features.</p>
<p><i>Please note that starting October 22, the new gallery will be going through a soft release. On Monday, about 1/20 people will be able to view the new features. On Tuesday, 2/20, etc. leading up to the full release. You will have the choice to participate or wait it out while we await user feedback and bug fixes. On Monday, October 29, the new gallery will be released to all.</i></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">New homepage</span></b></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mj4Bm.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The gallery will now act as the Imgur homepage. This new homepage has upload capabilities, allowing you to drag and drop directly to the page, use the upload toolbox in the top right or use the new upload icon, which remains in the toolbar throughout your Imgur experience.<br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dtPFe.png" alt="" /> </center></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Uploading to the gallery</span></b></p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZVRWH.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>As you enter the uploader, you will notice the &#8220;add to gallery&#8221; option. Clicking this will require you to add a gallery title to your image. Choose wisely, for the title is a great factor in acquiring upvotes. <b><span style="font-size:1.1em">Adding multiple images to the gallery at once will automatically create an album.</b></span> If you would like to add multiple individual images, please wait and add them separately. Start upload and, like magic, your image will appear in the &#8220;new&#8221; section of the gallery! Now cross your fingers and hope that Imgurians embrace your submission.<b> <span style="font-size:1.1em">Images added to the gallery will not be private! Your username will be associated with each image. </b></span></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l6LGi.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Image and Comment Sorting</span></b></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ayYCc.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This new gallery also allows for easier and, dare we say, better sorting. Use the header to change from new (images being added in real time to the gallery) to hot (highest scoring images) to top of the week, month year or all time. You can also sort by virality, score or time. Virality is a score that combines views, votes and time into one to give you the most popular images at the moment. </p>
<p>EDIT: Images will still be added based on the popularity algorithm that is part of the &#8220;old gallery.&#8221; The difference is that these images are no longer considered new. They have already been shared around the web and stood the test of time, therefore they are added straight to the hot section. The &#8220;new&#8221; section you are used to is now hottest images sorted by time. </p>
<p>By implementing a smarter algorithm to sort comments, we hope to combat the idea that the first post will be top comment regardless of its overall quality compared to the other, later comments. Introducing the &#8220;best&#8221; ranking. Simply put, it uses lots of math to come up with a confidence score for each comment that does not factor time. When a few people have voted on a comment, you get a rough idea of its quality. A comment with 100 upvotes but 50 downvotes has a lower confidence rating than a comment with 30 upvotes and 0 downvotes, despite that it has more overall points. The algorithm will create a hypothetical situation and assume that, if everyone were given the chance to see the second comment, it would be ranked higher. We hope that this improves the quality of top comments and make your votes count more.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re one of those people who loves to read the replies, you can now expand and collapse all replies as well.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rAPg7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">User moderation</span></b></p>
<p>We want the gallery to remain a fun place for all users to enjoy. There is to be no NSFW material in the gallery whatsoever! That being said, we need your help to make sure it continues to meet community standards. Please freely use the &#8220;report&#8221; option to alert us to anything that is not Imgur quality. Any user who blatantly ignores this rule will be perma-banned from the gallery.<br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/w3jgG.png" alt="" /></center><br />
We&#8217;re not cops, but for the good of the community, please abide by the following do&#8217;s and dont&#8217;s.</p>
<p>DO:<br />
-Share any image you find hilarious, cute, inspring, funny or otherwise universally appealing. If you&#8217;re unsure of what is universally appealing, check the hot section of the gallery.<br />
-Report comments and images you find breaking the rules.<br />
-Use your upvotes and downvotes wisely. </p>
<p>DO NOT:<br />
-Share any distasteful, pornographic, illegal or offensive images. Check the <a href="../../../tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.<br />
-Post NSFW material or hate speech in the comments.<br />
-Knowingly repost content.<br />
-Post personal information (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.)<br />
-Spam</p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">The Imguraffe</span></b></p>
<p>In April 2012, we played an April Fool&#8217;s joke on our users, changing the site to a giraffe print and changing the logo to the &#8220;Imguraffe.&#8221; The joke was on us, however, as our users fell in love with the classy bloke, leading Imgur to dub the Imguraffe our official mascot! From April til now, we have been working on the perfect design that we think captures the personality and charm of an official Imgur mascot. That design is finally here! You will see the Imguraffe on the site associated with various community actions and activities. Introducing, your Imguraffe: </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OvxRXl.png" alt="Imguraffe" /></center></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">The reputation system</span></b></p>
<p><s>There are now six life stages in the Imgur reputation system. After you achieve Glorious the first time, you will be moved into a new category, Copper, that starts again at Neutral. The remaining stages are Bronze, Iron, Silver, Gold and Imgurite. For each new stage you achieve, your gallery profile will display a new Imguraffe medallion. The highest ranking will be Imgurite Glorious. All users start with the wooden chip shown below. Points can be earned through various gallery activity such as posting comments, receiving votes and submitting to the gallery. </s></p>
<p>The reputation system has been updated due to popular demand! Please check out the most recent blog post for a message from our founder about the new NEW system. <a href="http://imgur.com/blog/2012/10/24/reputation-revised/">Reputation Revised</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy these new Imgur features! All of the updates here were user-submitted, and we really care about your opinions. If you would like to share any site suggestions, bugs, questions or concerns, please email <a href="mailto:support@imgur.com">support@imgur.com</a>. </p>

						<p>In case you missed the recent episode of MythBusters (S9EP43) that featured Imgur, here&#8217;s your chance to see why we were so excited. If you ever posted a comment on a Titanic image, you may be famous!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HaOiC.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can also see a second of it in this episode preview (head to 0:25):</p>

<p>The MythBusters investigated whether or not Jack and Rose both could have fit on the plank in James Cameron&#8217;s Titanic. Imgur users battled and requested that MythBusters settle the debate once and for all. They heard our calls, guys! </p>
<p>SPOILER ALERT!</p>
<p>It turns out that Rose did have an advantage over Jack in that she was on top of the water, whereas he was in it, thereby avoiding death for a few more crucial minutes. As for whether or not they both fit, it turns out it&#8217;s plausible. If Rose would have untied her life vest and helped support the plank, they both would have lived. You&#8217;re a real jerk, Rose!</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>There is a star amongst us. We now know him as Alexander Rhodes, legendary actor, but he wasn&#8217;t always a superstar acting alongside lesser known supporting actors like <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/sxVwp">Tom Cruise</a>. Once among the dregs of the least visited profiles on IMDb, Mr. Rhodes traveled the road to stardom and arrived at the #8 most viewed profile, the top listing for the cast of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790724/">Jack Reacher</a> and the first search result when you type in as little as <a href="http://imgur.com/CCMdt">&#8220;Al&#8221;</a>. And, thanks to the help of the Imgur community, it only took 14 days.</p>
<p>It all began with a simple post on Reddit. Alexander was offering his professional acting opinion to some friends when he decided to post a link to his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4659673/">IMDb profile</a>.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/THSXn.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Because IMDb ranks the cast based on profile views, the views from Reddit quickly helped Alexander move up the ladder.<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/U7R6B"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/U7R6B.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Fifth place was never going to be good enough. User challengeacceptedagain posed a new challenge for Imgurians.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ziAxj.png" alt="Get him above Tom Cruise!" /></p>
<p>In as little as three days, views from Imgurians and Redditors had gotten our star to #1, where he had always been in our hearts.<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/9Jxx1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9Jxx1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Imgur&#8217;s own Sarah talked with the Suspicious Onlooker himself on his rise to fame and perfecting the skill of onlooking suspiciously.</p>
<p class="green"><b>Tell us about your upcoming movie and your role.</b></p>
<p>Sure, the movie is called Jack Reacher. It has something to do with a serial killer, explosions, a fast car that Tom Cruise likes to drive, and killing. But seriously it is based on an awesome book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Shot-Jack-Reacher-No/dp/0385336683">&#8220;One Shot&#8221; by Lee Child</a> and a character, Jack Reacher, that had a huge fan following even before the movie was produced. I play the role of Suspicious Onlooker. I perform suspicious onlooking in reaction to something very suspicious that Jack Reacher is doing.</p>
<p class="green"><b>How do you train yourself to reach such high levels of suspicion?</p>
<p></b>I simply become the character and immerse myself, as that character, in the situation. After that, the suspicion comes naturally.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DD6HCl.jpg" alt="Alexander Rhodes onlooking suspiciously" /> <span style="font-size: 0.85em"><i>Alexander Rhodes onlooking suspiciously</i></span></p>
<p class="green"><b>It must take a lot of strength to get to that place mentally. How do you prepare before going on set? </p>
<p></b>Try to go to bed early the night before because without fail I will be too excited to fall asleep as quickly as usual. Even with being an extra, additional PA work, and casting stuff I&#8217;m just always super excited. I love the lifestyle and atmosphere of movie sets, love learning through observation (okay, onlooking) of the other actors and crew, and it is more social than other jobs. Generally everybody is really nice. Other than that it depends on what my job is. If I&#8217;m going to be on camera as cast or an extra, I try not to touch my face and change my pillowcase to avoid any surprise pimples, and pack a duffel bag full of clothing and stuff. If I&#8217;m working crew or casting, I just make sure I&#8217;m wearing sturdy shoes, bring a tape measure, a small notebook for to-do lists on the fly, and a couple pens. Not much to it!</p>
<p class="green"><b>Besides Tom Cruise, what&#8217;s the strangest thing you&#8217;ve encountered in the movie business?</p>
<p></b>Probably running into Matt Damon in a creepy basement bathroom. I was on the set of &#8220;Promised Land&#8221; as an extra and was just trying to take a piss. I guess that is more awesome than strange. For the record, Matt Damon seemed like a great guy.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3110a.png" alt="Alexander Rhodes with Matt Damon" /><span style="font-size: 0.85em"><i>Alexander Rhodes with Matt Damon</i></span></p>
<p class="green"><b>Speaking of Tom, what&#8217;s he like? Does he really <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/drgqI">smell all of his appliances</a> before buying them or just fridges? </b></p>
<p>From my very limited experience with Tom Cruise, he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. Everybody on set liked him &#8211; from what I heard, he hired a full time espresso cart out of pocket to make drinks for the crew and was just really nice to everybody. From observation you could immediately tell that he is passionate about film making. Originally I was in the foreground of the shot but they thought that my coat was too light and drew too much attention to itself. They ended up moving me a hundred feet away into the far, far background. After another take Tom Cruise talked to the director and improvised the Suspicious Onlooker part for me and instructed me on how to perform it. If it wasn&#8217;t for Tom Cruise, I would have never been the Suspicious Onlooker. Haven&#8217;t gone shopping with him yet so can neither conform nor deny the appliance sniffing.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nLVix.jpg" alt="Tom Cruise is a huge Alexander Rhodes fan" /><span style="font-size: 0.85em"><i>Tom Cruise fanning out over Alexander Rhodes</i></span></p>
<p class="green"><b>Which of the characters you&#8217;ve played is your favorite?</b></p>
<p>Definitely Suspicious Onlooker.</p>
<p class="green"><b>Mine too. How did you get the nickname Slickback?</b></p>
<p>Hahahahahahaha. The Reddit and Imgur communities are hilariously awesome &#8211; that&#8217;s all I have to say about that.</p>
<p class="green"><b>Who would you like to kiss on-screen?</b></p>
<p>Probably <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/eMaax">Emma Watson</a> because I think she is pretty and seems like a nice, genuine person.</p>
<p class="green"><b>You&#8217;re a true Imgurian at heart. It&#8217;s been really great following your rise to success and helping you beat Tom Cruise. I know the Imgur community is really happy for you. What&#8217;s your reaction to all of the recent attention? Anything you&#8217;d like to say to the Imgur and Reddit communities?</b></p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t fully registered yet. My mind still refuses to accept that this is really me. I feel like an observer in this hilarious campaign. Probably if I had to pick one overriding reaction it would be laughter. This has made me laugh even harder than <a href="http://imgur.com/9gjoj">this picture</a>. Also a slight amount of panic. As for Imgur and Reddit, I&#8217;d like to say thank you so much for all of this. This has been the funniest, most ridiculous, amazing ride of my life. Regardless of if anything comes out of this (a career), I will always be looking for ways to show tangible appreciation to both the Imgur and Reddit communities. Expect a ton of AMAs, giveaways, video blogs, interaction and basically just planning on doing everything I can to include you guys in this experience.</p>
<p class="green"><b>Thanks, Alexander! Best of luck in your career, and I can&#8217;t wait to see you as Suspicious Onlooker when the movie is released.</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have my management team contact my publicist to get one of the interns to mail you an autograph.</p>

						<p class=green>Oh, September. Who could forget it? Summer became fall. Students went back to school and started spending every class on Imgur. To everyone&#8217;s liking, grumpy cats gained popularity. Apple Maps became the butt of all jokes. The presidential election and the STAHP meme began to take off. Donuts remained delicious.

						<p>For those of you who use Twitter, sharing images from Imgur just got a lot better! Twitter and Imgur have partnered to bring you in-tweet image previews. We hope that this will allow your followers to better engage with your tweets and encourage you to share your favorite Imgur images on Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gs5Awl.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When sharing on Twitter, please keep in mind that this integration <strong>will not work</strong> with the direct links (those are the i.imgur.com/example.jpg looking ones), but functions only with the main URLs (those look like imgur.com/example). The &#8220;share on Twitter&#8221; button is the first share button below an image. Just click that button and a window will pop up with the link automatically entered on your Twitter. Click submit and your image preview will show up right in your tweet.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j9wpnl.png" alt="Share on Twitter" /></p>
<p>The good news doesn&#8217;t stop there! The Imgur/Twitter integration also works on mobile.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/19pR8.gif" alt="WOOO!" /></p>
<p>Go forth, beloved Imgurians, and tweet!</p>
<p>Also, if you would be so kind, <a href="http://twitter.com/imgur">follow us on Twitter</a>!</p>
