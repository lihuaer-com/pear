						<p>It&#8217;s not just you&#8211;Imgur looks different. That&#8217;s because, starting today,* Imgur is even more awesome! Every day, Imgurians unearth the most viral images across the Internet. Our redesign is all about giving more power to you to customize the Imgur experience and discover more of the things you love. Our team has been hard at work putting this together, and we can’t wait to see where the community takes it. </p>
<p><i>*This redesign is in beta and will soon get rolled out to everyone. Until then, we want to hear your comments or thoughts! </i></p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1g1LTBF.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1g1LTBF.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Tagging &#038; Trends</span></b></p>
<p>At the heart of the new design is tagging. Imgurians can suggest and vote on tags for individual images. This is a simple, but big change: you can now browse the gallery by trending tags, create your own personalized custom galleries by combining tags, and even filter out images with certain tags you don’t want to see anymore. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7zPO9IO.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7zPO9IO.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Any user may suggest any tag for any image. To make sure tags are accurate, the top two tags based on score will be displayed in the gallery. Tags can be used to determine trends, improve image search, and help you discover more of the content you wish to see. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Gi9tf5S.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gi9tf5S.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Custom Galleries</span></b></p>
<p>You&#8217;re no longer limited to the default galleries. Custom galleries give you the chance to browse exactly what you&#8217;d like to see, or closely follow a specific tag. The first custom gallery you&#8217;ll see on the dropdown menu is called Filtered Out. Any tag that you add to your Filtered Out gallery won&#8217;t be seen again on the rest of Imgur. (This is important for you Game of Thrones fans who don&#8217;t get to watch the episodes on Sundays.) </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/niYDH9d.png?1"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/niYDH9d.png?1" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Personalized custom galleries can be created by adding any combination of tags. These custom galleries update in real time and can be sorted by popularity or newest first. You can create as many custom galleries as you want! In the mood for cute stuff? Follow Sarah&#8217;s lead and create a Cuteness Overload gallery. <a href="http://imgur.com/g/uZW3q/viral">Click here to save it!</a> You can share any custom gallery with another user via the unique gallery URL, or add another user&#8217;s gallery to your account by selecting &#8220;save to my account.&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SrpjiEu.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SrpjiEu.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>If you see something while browsing that you&#8217;d like to add to a custom gallery, click that tag to add it. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cs921C6.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Search</span></b></p>
<p>10/10 teens literally could not even with our old search feature. Luckily, search has been improved by leaps and bounds. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lPQnHMX.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lPQnHMX.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Choose the rocket ship icon to blast off to advanced search options, which will let you search by almost anything&#8211;title, tag, image size, image type, etc. It even works for the text within some images!</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/N8R5OpM.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N8R5OpM.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p class="green"><b><span style="font-size:1.4em">Rising &#038; Today&#8217;s Best Comments</span></b></p>
<p>User Submitted can now be sorted by Rising. Rising images are newer images that have gotten a bit of traction, but may not have made their way to the top of the User Sub gallery. The idea behind Rising is to give users the chance to see more of what User Submitted has to offer and prevent great content from being lost to oblivion. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3vVQePa.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>The best comments of the day will now be marked within the image page. </p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, GiantShoe.</p>

						<p>Taking your image viral is no easy feat. You may receive many downvotes on your path to the front page. You may have offensive reaction GIFs hurled your way. Even with a clever title and great original content, your image may sink into oblivion, but there is a light at the end of the upload button. That light is Imgur Viralizer. Brace yourself. The front page is coming. </p>
<p>When an image URL is first shared from Imgur to a social network, we begin collecting data in order to compute an overall popularity score. This score takes into account the number of places the image was posted, the number of social media interactions (tweets, Facebook shares, Reddit likes, etc.), as well as time. The data is then used to determine which images will be added to the Most Viral Gallery. Since the release of <a href="http://imgur.com/blog/2014/01/27/image-analytics/">Imgur Analytics</a>, our Special Initiatives Specialists at the previously top secret L.A.B.G.U.R (Laughter Augmenting Bureau of Giraffe User Research) we&#8217;ve also been using advanced statistics to track what, exactly, causes one image to go viral when another doesn&#8217;t. The findings are astounding. </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IlHx1Ggl.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em"><i>Inside L.A.B.G.U.R</i></span></p>
<p>Viral images share certain qualities. They all have worldwide appeal, which is to say they resonate with a large audience of varied cultures and geographic locations. They have a great caption and sometimes a relevant description. But we can go deeper. Using our findings from Imgur Analytics, we&#8217;ve narrowed down very specific content that has a greater chance of going viral, and we&#8217;re sharing these secrets with the Imgur community so that you, too, can profit. Spoiler: CATS.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fRIjTsu.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fRIjTsu.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em"><i>Research inside L.A.B.G.U.R</i></span></p>
<p>It is with great pleasure that we introduce this exciting new feature. With the click of a button your image will be instantly Viralized, greatly simplifying the thought process and taking the stress out of the viral image process. The simple image sharer now means so much more. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image uploader tool from the Imgur front page. </p>
<p>Step 2: Select &#8220;viralize it!&#8221; then upload your image as normal.</p>
<p><centeR><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EA4mzhT.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>Step 3: ???</p>
<p>Step 4: PROFIT. Your image has increased its probability of going viral.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1dWWt4El.jpg" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>*NOTE: Imgur Viralizer only works on single image uploads, not albums. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/csxNtqh.gif" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>It works for comments, too! Using linguistic research on top comments, we can now accurately generate a guaranteed successful comment. Simply click the new &#8220;generate&#8221; button and let the upvotes roll in. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gR9sCDX.png?1" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>Your result is an instant top comment. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O0iBxwg.png?1" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>Let Imgur Viralizer create your viral content. Go forth, beloved Imgurians, and reap the upvotes.</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>In designing the messaging feature originally, we chose to go with a more email-like interface and functionality. This worked wonderfully for a long time, but we have found that Imgurians have been creating friendships via messaging and continuing conversations for longer durations. This left the messages page cluttered, and your scrolling finger tired, leading us to re-think this feature set. The new chat style layout allows conversations of any size to be manageable.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MEupNL5.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MEupNL5.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>On the right is the list of users with whom you currently have conversations. Clicking on these loads the conversation into the left panel. It also includes the number of messages in that conversation and whether or not it’s unread. The plus sign allows you to create a new conversation with a user. The left panel contains the actual conversation, starting with the newest message on the bottom. The conversation will update in real-time as new messages come in. You can also use the refresh button to refresh the conversation or the gear menu to delete, block or report a conversation.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xC9rVYDl.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Real-time Notifications</strong></span></h3>
<p><center><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/nDDo2b5"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nDDo2b5.gif" alt="" /></a></center></p>
<p>With this new messaging system also comes the most exciting thing since the user-submitted gallery. Real-time notifications! No more refreshing to see that coveted red flag. The notification will appear immediately, and you can hover to see what&#8217;s new. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2lGVr0X.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not on the messages or replies page, you&#8217;ll be alerted by a quick pop up in the lower right corner when you get something new. If you&#8217;re in another tab (though why would you ever leave Imgur?), your tab will also let you know. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZJFXhXg.png" alt="" /><br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/rhajFAu.png?1" alt="" /><br />
</center></p>
<p>Replies can now be found in their own section of your gallery profile. New replies will be highlighted in blue&#8211;no more searching aimlessly for your latest reply!</p>

						<p>In the past year, Imgur has rounded out our platform offering to extend the image sharing experience from the web to mobile with an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgur/id639881495?mt=8">iOS app</a>, an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgur.mobile">Android app</a>, and the <a href="http://imgur.com/memegen">Imgur Meme Generator</a>. Today, we are thrilled to announce that Imgur is now seeing <strong>100 million monthly unique users</strong>! </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3wd5C88l.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Since day one, we’ve dedicated ourselves to building the best possible user experience for Imgurians. We prioritize our creative community and encourage everyone to take charge of their experience. With the help of your support and feedback, we’re making sure this experience stays awesome as we grow and evolve, and we appreciate your support in helping us reach this incredible milestone.</p>
<p>Imgur’s service now supports more than 1,200,000,000 daily image views that are core to information sharing channels, the most popular and highly trafficked social networks, massive online communities, popular pop culture blogs and web forums for all kinds of content. To continue to offer you the best &#8220;no limits&#8221; image hosting experience available online, we have added HTTPS support sitewide to allow for secure browsing all across Imgur. We have also decreased the limitations to allow you to upload larger filetypes with lower compression. These limits vary for anonymous users, registered account holders and <a href="../../../register/upgrade.html">pro users</a>.  </p>
<p><center><img style="background-color: #181817; border:0" src="http://i.imgur.com/m8J2Azb.png" alt="" /> </center></p>

<p>Brace yourself. Meme creation is now possible on Imgur! </p>
<p>In the past, memes have been created elsewhere on the Internet, then uploaded to Imgur for storage or sharing. By adding content creation tools to Imgur, we aim to simplify this process. Creating, sharing and saving memes can all be done from your Imgur! </p>
<p>The <a href="http://imgur.com/g/memes">Memes Gallery</a> will allow users to browse viral memes, remix memes made by others or create all new memes from scratch. As with uploads, memes can be stored in an Imgur account. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IvIAYbr.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>To create your own meme using the <a href="http://imgur.com/memegen">Meme Generator</a>, click &#8216;make a meme&#8217; in the upper right hand corner. You can select a popular meme, sort by meme name or upload a template of your own. Click &#8216;make this meme!&#8217; to complete the process. Your meme can be titled and shared in the public Memes Gallery. Use the share icons to share to other parts of the web. </p>

						<p>Oh no! The Imgur sales guys have hijacked Tech Tuesday! Today we are going to talk a little about how we handle our advertising business. Don’t panic, this post will cover some new ad technology that we are implementing today in the hope of improving the overall role that ads have on our site. </p>
<p>As many of you know, we are an independent bootstrapped company.  Since we offer a free service, understandably, people always want to know how we keep the lights on, pay our ginormous hosting bills and still manage to keep the Imguraffe well fed. </p>
<p>We are able to support the company with revenue generated from ad sales, <a href="../../../register/upgrade.html">Pro accounts</a>, <a href="https://www.mashape.com/imgur/apiv3#!documentation">commercial hosting</a> and schwag from <a href="http://store.imgur.com/">the store</a>.  A sincere thanks to all of you that support us through these paid products or decide to not use Adblock while browsing Imgur! </p>
<p>On the ad sales side, we work with large branded advertisers as well as ad networks. Ad networks are third-party companies that work with thousands of websites and hundreds of advertisers. They act as the middleman, bringing Imgur ad campaigns from advertisers we don’t work with directly. Although we have very strict guidelines for the types of ads we accept (only two formats, no auto-sound ads, no auto-expanding ads, no pop-overs or unders), we can’t always identify every campaign that’s running. Even with a ton of screening mechanisms in place, sometimes bad ads sneak through. Please know we hate these ads, too! We use every report we get through support@imgur.com to track down the offending networks and campaigns and squash them as soon as we can.   </p>
<p>Ads play an important role in supporting the site, but we would prefer that they add value, or at least not detract from your experience.  As part of our ongoing effort to maintain better control of our ads and to improve our ad quality, we are looking to develop direct relationships with our advertisers. To forward that goal we are excited to announce a new self-serve ad platform. This new system will allow you (or your company) to easily setup an ad campaign that will be displayed to your fellow Imgurians. </p>
<p>How does it work? Easy.</p>
<p>1.	Visit our <a href="http://imgur.com/advertise/selfservicedisplay">self-service page</a><br />
2.	Choose to target US only or the entire world<br />
3.	Select your budget<br />
4.	Upload your ad (or you can create one on the platform)<br />
5.	Enter payment details and submit</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XmFHBsbl.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>After a quick review to ensure that the creative looks good and your landing page is working, we will set the campaign live, typically the same day. </p>
<p>Aside from knowing that our community is full of awesome, funny, good-natured folks that love cat GIFs, we have also provided a few quick stats about our audience. If you are interested in targeting a specific geography (city or country) or if have any other questions about display ads or sponsored image ads please email us at sales@imgur.com. </p>
<p>75M+ unique visitors (almost 50M from US)<br />
340M total visits per month<br />
4.1B page views per month<br />
70% Male<br />
Over 50% Ages 18-34</p>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>We’ve updated the way images from User Submitted are added to Most Viral. We don&#8217;t want there to be a set number of points a post has to achieve to make it onto the front page. Instead, we&#8217;d like a post to achieve a certain level of popularity in relation to all the other posts. This will guarantee that the very best content ends up in the Most Viral section of the gallery.</p>
<p>In lieu of score alone, we now use a special algorithm that computes a virality score, taking into account votes, views and time. This is the same algorithm used when sorting the gallery by &#8216;popularity,&#8217; now applied as the Most Viral gatekeeper. It&#8217;s also the same algorithm that determines which web-shared content reaches the front page. The current images in the Most Viral gallery create a minimum score that User Submitted candidates must pass, thus eliminating the problem with vote inflation that we have been experiencing. Some may have 300 points, some may have 30, but if their virality scores are high, both will make it to the front page.</p>
<p>Here is some of the great User Submitted content that has us laughing today:</p>
<p><b>Bang! Please?</b> submitted by <a href="http://imgur.com/user/TheRealNoms">TheRealNoms</a><br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8uumxMs.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><b>Exactly</b> submitted by <a href="http://imgur.com/user/henry0314">henry0314</a><br />

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/55mRmQol.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We hope you will continue to enjoy great images in the Most Viral gallery as well as use your votes to help your fellow Gatekeepers find the best images in User Submitted!</p>

						<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the latest addition to our uploader&#8211;Upload via Snail Mail! </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5FdD0le.png" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>At Imgur, our users&#8217; input is the driving force behind all of our decisions. With the rise of the hipster, we were forced to ask ourselves, &#8220;How can we attract the film camera user?&#8221; It became evident to us that a more non-traditional type of uploading is necessary to appeal to a broad user base which includes film users, the computer illiterate, and those afraid of radiation from scanners. Snail mail is a proven method of data transfer that has been around long before the Internet. To stay on the forefront of technology, we&#8217;re going back to the roots of communication. </p>
<p>In standard Imgur style, let&#8217;s let the GIFs do the talking. </p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Py4Juuy.gif" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>Does the front page of Imgur confuse and frustrate you? Have you found yourself screaming, &#8220;HOW DO I UPLOAD?&#8221; Keep calm and give away your computer&#8211;Imgur now does the hard work for you. Still on dial-up? No worries&#8211;you won&#8217;t even need the Internet to share your cat pictures. Perhaps the upload process is too fast for you to follow? You&#8217;ll have tons of time to do other things while you wait 2-3 weeks to receive your URL!</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zCnMNdl.gif" alt="" /></center></p>
<p>This upload method requires minimal computer interaction or effort. For just the price of postage, you can upload your image for free! Simply mail your image to the Imgur PO Box. When we receive your image in the mail, we&#8217;ll do all the work! Just sit back, relax, and wait for your unique image URL to be mailed back to you. Then use your landline or mobile phone to call your friends, coworkers and family to tell them to look at your image on the Internet. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>
<p>Mail your image to:</p>
<p>Imgur.com<br />
PO Box 420773<br />
San Francisco, CA 94142-0773</p>
<p>Please make sure to include your image and your mailing address. If submitting multiple images, indicate whether or not you&#8217;d like to make an album. Please allow 2-3 weeks to receive your URL. </p>
<p>*Imgur will not be held liable for images lost in the mail.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the new feature.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Your overly attached Imgur team</p>

					<small>Wednesday, March 20th, 2013</small>

					<div class="entry">
						<p>We&#8217;re proud to introduce a brand new feature that allows you to keep track of all of your favorite images and albums.</p>
<p>We noticed that a lot of users have been treating the &#8220;liked images&#8221; section of their gallery profiles as a favorites list, which means that they were reserving their upvotes for only the very best images that they wanted to track. Or, if the image wasn&#8217;t in the gallery, people would often re-upload it into their own account. This was a poor user experience. We want you to be able to feel like you can freely give an upvote to any image you think needs more attention, and we certainly don&#8217;t want you to clutter up your own personal account images with images had to upload again.</p>
<p>Keeping these problems in mind, we&#8217;re finally ready to release the <em>favorites</em> feature. You can <em>fav</em> any image or album on the site (the hotkey is &#8217;0&#8242;), and you can even <em>fav</em> images that are directly linked (where the URL is like http://i.imgur.com/1234567.jpg). Just add /fav to the end of the url (like this: http://i.imgur.com/OJqW4Tr.jpg/fav).</p>
<p>All of your favorite images are stored in a separate section of your account, which you can access from your account menu. This section is completely private. The favorited images here will appear in their simple forms with no gallery comments when you browse them. The images you&#8217;ve added to your favorites from the Imgur Gallery will also be shown in the &#8220;Gallery favorites&#8221; section of your gallery profile and can be browsed by other users similar to the old &#8220;Liked images&#8221; section.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also made the decision to get rid of the &#8220;Liked images&#8221; section in gallery profiles. To do this, we&#8217;ve moved all of your liked images into your favorites as a default. If you find that your favorites section is all cluttered up with images that you&#8217;ve liked in the past, you can chose to clear out your favorites and start from scratch.</p>
<p>The hotkey to favorite an image is 0.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite any image or album with the fav button:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RRwYcdx.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Favorite any image or album with /fav:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z5Qzds5.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Access your favorites from the account menu:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6J4HF4f.png?1" /></div>
<p><strong>Access your favorite gallery images from your gallery profile:</strong></p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zdfxo47.png?1" /></div>
<p>So get back to browsing, vote freely and save your favorites. If you get a break, let us know what you think of the new feature in the blog comments.</p>
